Healthcare dataset analaysis

In this notebook, I extracted the meaningful data from the log file that contains measurement values of healthcare attributes such white blood cells, red blood cell, hemoglobin and many more. 
Then I converted the extracted data into a pandas dataframe and saved it as csv for future references.
Then I performed basic statistics on the data to detect different measurements and outliers.
